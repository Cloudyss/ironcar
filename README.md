## SETUP

### Easy setup with install.sh

You can easily setup everything on the raspi using the install.sh bash. Just launching `.Â /install.sh` will install keras, tensorflow, nodejs and some other dependencies in the requirements. This should take 2-3 hours... (scipy is very long to install). At the end of the install, it will ask you if you want to let us configure the raspi for you enabling the pi camera, i2c connections and augmenting the swap size which is very small by default. 
And that's it, you should be ready to go to the Launching part!!

### Manual setup

You can install the requirements from requirements_raspi yourself, but you will need to install tensorflow as well as nodejs and npm. You will also need to install the node packages from packages.json. 
Last you will need to configure your camera and any other device to be enabled on the pi. 

### Troubleshooting

## Launching
In order to communicate between the car, the laptop and another device like a smartphone,
we used socketio on python and nodejs.Therefore, we need to launch a server node on the raspi
and clients on other devices. A python client on the raspi ensure the communication with the 
car hardware (motors, camera  and other potential sensors if you want to add any).


### On the raspberry pi
Two programs are to be launched on the raspi. You can use screen if you don't want to carry 
a laptop. Those two programs can be run as daemon if you really don't want to use a laptop. 

* server node: `node car_server.js` This will launch the node server. By default, it runs on 
the raspi localhost on the port 8000. 
* python client: `python ironcar_master.py` This will launch the python client that directly
controls the car and takes commmands from the node server.

### On the laptop
You can Launch controller.py on the laptop (don't forget to change the ip to put your raspi ip)
if you have a gamepad to control the car in training/ direction auto. You might need to change
this script to adapt to your gamepad. As an example, we used a xbox gamepad and listened to the
left joystick for direction and RT trigger for the gas, LT to break. 

### On any device
The user interface is a javascript client that can be launched in any browser in theory 
(chrome and safari have been tested). Just go to YOUR_RASPI_IP:8000 and you should be able to 
choose the mode, the model, the speed, and control the car with a keyboard.
